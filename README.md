# hello-world
First github project

Hi there! My name is Pedro Araujo and I'm from Brazil. Although I've been working with software development for 3 years, this is my first GitHub Account.
I work with SAP Business One, coding with C#.NET. This is my only experience with code and I decided to improve myself studying and learning different things like patterns and methodologies.
I'm 24 now and I'm really engaged with this. I hope to learn a lot and help if possible.

Regards.
